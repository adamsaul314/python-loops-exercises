# PART 1: FOR LOOPS
# =========================================================

# Exercise 1: Print numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop.
# Your solution here:

# for num in range(1, 11):
#     print(num)

# Exercise 2: Print all even numbers between 1 and 20.
# Your solution here:

# for i in range(1,21):
#     if(i % 2 == 0):
#         print(i)

# Exercise 3: Loop through a list of fruits and print each one.
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
# Your solution here:

# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(fruit)

# Exercise 4: Loop through a string and print each character.
word = "PYTHON"
# Your solution here:

# for char in word:
#     print(char)

# Exercise 5: Loop through a dictionary and print each key and value.
student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 20, "grade": "A"}
# Your solution here:

# for k, v in student.items():
#     print (k, v)


# =========================================================
# PART 2: WHILE LOOPS
# =========================================================

# Exercise 6: Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
# Your solution here:

# Exercise 7: Keep asking the user for input until they type "exit".
# (Tip: use input() function)
# Your solution here:

# Exercise 8: Countdown from 10 to 1, then print "Blast off!".
# Your solution here:

# Exercise 9: Write a while loop that keeps doubling a number
# starting from 1 until it is greater than 1000.
# Your solution here:


# =========================================================
# PART 3: LOOP CONTROL (break, continue, pass)
# =========================================================

# Exercise 10: Loop from 1 to 10, but stop the loop completely if you hit 7.
# Your solution here:

# Exercise 11: Loop from 1 to 10, skip printing the number 5.
# Your solution here:

# Exercise 12: Use a loop with "pass" as a placeholder.
# (Hint: create a for loop that does nothing yet)
# Your solution here:


# =========================================================
# PART 4: LOOP ELSE CLAUSE
# =========================================================

# Exercise 13: Search for the number 3 in a list.
# If found, print "Found!", otherwise print "Not found" using loop-else.
nums = [1, 2, 4, 6]
# Your solution here:

# Exercise 14: Check if a number is prime using a loop with else.
# (Prime: only divisible by 1 and itself)
# Your solution here:


# =========================================================
# PART 5: NESTED LOOPS
# =========================================================

# Exercise 15: Print a multiplication table from 1â€“5.
# Your solution here:

# Exercise 16: Print the following pattern (nested loops):
# *
# **
# ***
# ****
# *****
# Your solution here:

# Exercise 17: Print a grid of numbers like this (nested loops):
# 1 2 3
# 1 2 3
# 1 2 3
# Your solution here:


# =========================================================
# PART 6: CHALLENGE PROBLEMS
# =========================================================

numbers = [12, 45, 7, 23, 56, 89, 3]
# Your solution here:

# Exercise 20: Reverse a string using a loop (no slicing).
text = "Python"
# Your solution here:

# Exercise 21: Count vowels in a string using a loop.
sentence = "Loops are powerful in Python"
# Your solution here:

# Exercise 22: Flatten this nested list using nested loops:
nested = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
# Expected output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
